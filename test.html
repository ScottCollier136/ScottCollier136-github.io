                    <p>Hello. Welcome to my Webpage</p>
                    <p>If you are here, it is probably because I am applying to a job at your company.
                        In which case, I have made this webpage to go into more detail about myself than I can in a single-page resume.
                        In lieu of a portfolio, I will be posting my solutions to what are considered common programming interview questions.
                        All of which will be programmed in Java.</p>

                    <h3>Work:</h3>
                    <p>I worked at Jarvis, a consulting/contracting agency in Toronto,
                        with the goal of training prospective programmers to work with Big Data in the Banking industry.
                        The training took several months, after which I was contracted to work at CIBC.
                        I was to work there for 2 years, acting as a software developer.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the pandemic happened. I managed to stay on, working from home, but eventually I was let go due to downsizing.</p>
                    <p></p>
