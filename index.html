    <h4>Jarvis: June 2019 - June 2020</h4>
    <p>I worked at Jarvis, a consulting/contracting agency in Toronto,
        with the goal of training prospective programmers to work with Big Data in the Banking industry.
        After several months of training and another interview process to see if I was ready, I was contracted out to work for CIBC</p>
    <h5>CIBC: November 2019 - June 2020</h5>
    Through Jarvis I worked for CIBC as a software developer. I worked with 2 teams on 2 different projects during my time there. 
        One to do with transferring data between servers, 
        and the other do do with re-making the fraud-management tools for CIBC workers.
    <h4>Autometrics: December 2021 - August 2022</h4>
    I worked for Autometrics, a small company that works in welding software and automation. I was hired by them to remake their existing backend
     using Apache Kafka and Python, work it into their existing solution, and optimize their code-base where I could.
