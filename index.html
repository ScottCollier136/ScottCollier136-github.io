    <p>Hello. Welcome to my Webpage</p>
    <p>If you are here, it is probably because I am applying to a job at your company.
        In which case, I have made this webpage to go into more detail about myself than I can in a single-page resume.
        In lieu of a portfolio, I will be posting my solutions to what are considered common programming interview questions.
        All of which will be programmed in Java.</p>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Work:</h3>
    <p>I worked at Jarvis, a consulting/contracting agency in Toronto,
        with the goal of training prospective programmers to work with Big Data in the Banking industry.
        The training took several months, after which I was contracted to work at CIBC.
        I was to work there for 2 years, acting as a software developer.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the pandemic happened. I managed to stay on, working from home, but eventually I was let go due to downsizing.</p>
