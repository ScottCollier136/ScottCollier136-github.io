    <p>Hello. Welcome to my Webpage</p>
    <p>If you are here, it is probably because I am applying to a job at your company.
        In which case, I have made this webpage to go into more detail about myself than I can in a single-page resume,
        and to show off basic programming skills and understanding.</p>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Skills:</h3>
    <p>Languages: Java, C, C++, Python, Scala, HTML, Javascript, SQL</p>
    <p>Tools: Git, Jira, Maven, IntelliJ</p>
    <p></p>


    <h3>Education:</h3>
    <p>I went to the University of Guelph, where I got my Bachelor's Degree majoring in Computer Science, and minored in Math.</p>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Work:</h3>
    <p>I worked at Jarvis, a consulting/contracting agency in Toronto,
        with the goal of training prospective programmers to work with Big Data in the Banking industry.
        The training took several months, after which I was contracted to work at CIBC.
        I was to work there for 2 years, acting as a software developer.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the pandemic happened. I managed to stay on, working from home, but eventually I was let go due to downsizing.</p>
    <p></p>
