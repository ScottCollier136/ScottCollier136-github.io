    <p>Hello. Welcome to my Webpage</p>
    <p>If you are here, it is probably because I am applying to a job at your company.
        In which case, I have made this webpage to go into more detail about myself than I can in a single-page resume,
        and to show off basic programming skills and understanding.</p>
    <p> About: This section is an overview of my education and job history</p>
    <p> Experience: This section is a more detailed description of my work experience.</p>
