    <h2>Frequent Questions I Get Asked During Interviews</h2>
    <h3>Do you prefer front-end, back-end, or full-stack?</h3>
    <p> I mostly have back-end experience, but I wouldn't go so far as to say I have a preferance. I'm willing to try anything.</p>
    <h3>Do you have experience working in teams and/or an agile environment?</h3>
    <p> Yes, I have worked in teams of up-to 6 active developers, in an agile environment.</p>
    <h3>Do you prefer a more casual or office-like environment?</h3>
    <p> From my experience both have their pros and cons. I don't specifically prefer one or the other, so long as the environment itself is friendly.</p>
    <h3>Have you ever taken a leadership role in a project?</h3>
    <p> When I worked at CIBC I took up a montoring role for a co-op student. When I worked for Autometrics I essentially managed a project by myself.</p>
    <h3>What would you say is your strength?</h3>
    <p> I have had to learn new technologies as I worked before, and think I am good at doing so.</p>
    <h3>What is a project you are proud of?</h3>
    <p> My work at Autometrics is easilly the most complex project I have done, so I am most proud of it.</p>
