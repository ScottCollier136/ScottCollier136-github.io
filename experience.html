    <h2>Jarvis: June 2019 - June 2020</h2>
    <h3>Toronto, Ontario</h3>
    <p>My training at Jarvis lasted from June till October of 2019.
        For this training I and a few others were brought in to go through learning classes, covering the basics of programming.</p>
    <p>We learned things from bash script, to Java programming with Object-Orientated Principles, to the basics of how Big Data works.</p>
    <p>After a certain amount of time I interviewed and was hired by CIBC's Toronto branch</p>

    <h2>CIBC: Nov 2019 - June 2020</h2>
    <h3>Toronto, Ontario</h3>
    <p>My employment at CIBC lasted from November of 2019, to June of 2020, with all work being from home starting mid March. During this time, I worked on 2 projects.</p>
    <p></p>

    <h3>BDD (Business Data Domain) Scala Project:</h3>
    <p>The first project I worked on involved the making of a new database. There was a team that wanted access to data they didn't have access to.
        While there were two databases that had this data, for whatever reason it was decided to make a new database instead of giving this team permission.
        I have been asked by several interviewers why this approach was taken, as it seems inefficient.
        As far as I know, the reason was solely because CIBC liked to partition everything behind permissions.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The project itself was this. There are two pre-existing databases, A and B. The current configuration is that there is a data transfer from A to B.
    We were tasked in making a database C, where C would be a midpoint for the team to read from. We would program a read from A to C, and then a write from C to B.
    During this, there is a minor change in the data, I believe it had to do with date formatting, but I can't recall the specifics.
    When I joined the project, the details of making the databases and configuring the transfers was already done or being finished by more senior developers.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The project itself was mainly programmed in Scala, also utilizing a bit of Spark.
        This was actually the first time I've programmed in Scala, and had to learn it as I went.
        I like to think it shows I am capable of picking up new technologies as I go.
        We utilized Jira for tickets, Git for version control, and an Agile development style.
        During this project I mainly developed unit tests for the data read functions,
        and developed conditionals to handle reads depending on the size and time since the last one took place.
        During this project a co-op student was hired, and I was tasked with looking after him.
        This mainly involved helping him get set up and finding him tasks to do for the project.</p>
    <p></p>

    <h3>The Fraud Project:</h3>
    <p>The second project I worked on was simply known as the "Fraud Project".
        This project involved the software used to detect when a fraudulent transaction was made.
        The software was third party, and the company wanted to update to a new version of it.
        Unfortunately, this software only includes the detection aspect which generated fraud tickets, while the systems used to manage the tickets were self-made.
        This wouldn't be a problem, except the new version of the software was considered a substantial step-up from the previous iteration,
        and our custom front-end wasn't compatible. With the fraud management team wanting some improvements to their UI,
        we were tasked with re-making the existing fraud-ticket interface as close as possible to its current form, while improving select elements.
        There were a lot of different kinds of fraud tickets that were used, and a lot of other systems that would have to be linked to this one, both up- and down-stream.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>While I was working on the project, I mainly worked with HTML, Javascript, and CSS. The focus at the time was generating the webpages and fill-able
        forms that the fraud team would use, as well as the general look and design. We used Jira for tickets, Git for version control, and an Agile development style with 2-week sprints.
        After we were all tasked with working from home, things were largely the same, after an adjustment period.
        Unfortunately, I was let go before certain parts of this project could really take off, so I mostly contributed in a web-design aspect.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>My work mostly consisted of creating pages and adjusting their looks to suit the clients, the fraud management team.
        They were very particular with how certain things looked and what exact language was used.
        Besides that there was a lot of work done on entry forms, with mandatory fields, checking for valid entries,
        and auto-generating/changing certain fields based on what was inputted into others.
        I was also sometimes tasked with mapping out the logic of the third-party software we used, to generate info for the fraud tickets.</p>
