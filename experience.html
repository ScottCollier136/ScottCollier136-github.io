    <h2>Jarvis: June 2019 - June 2020</h2>
    <p>My training at Jarvis lasted from June till October of 2019.
        For this training I and a few others were brought in to go through learning classes, covering the basics of programming.</p>
    <p>We learned things from bash script, to Java programming with Object-Orientated Principles, to the basics of how Big Data works.</p>
    <p>After a certain amount of time I interviewed and was hired by CIBC's Toronto branch</p>

    <h2>CIBC: Nov 2019 - June 2020</h2>
    <p>My employment at CIBC lasted from November of 2019, to June of 2020, with all work being from home starting mid March. During this time, I worked on 2 projects.</p>
    <p></p>

    <h3>BDD (Business Data Domain) Scala Project:</h3>
    <p>The first project I worked on involved the making of a new database. There was a team that wanted access to data they didn't have access to.
        While there were two databases that had this data, for whatever reason it was decided to make a new database instead of giving this team permission.
        I have been asked by several interviewers why this approach was taken, as it seems inefficient.
        As far as I know, the reason was solely because CIBC liked to partition everything behind permissions.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The project itself was this. There are two pre-existing databases, A and B. The current configuration is that there is a data transfer from A to B.
    We were tasked in making a database C, where C would be a midpoint for the team to read from. We would program a read from A to C, and then a write from C to B.
    During this, there is a minor change in the data, I believe it had to do with date formatting, but I can't recall the specifics.
    When I joined the project, the details of making the databases and configuring the transfers was already done or being finished by more senior developers.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The project itself was mainly programmed in Scala, also utilizing a bit of Spark. During this project I mainly developed unit tests for the data read functions,
        and developed conditionals to handle reads depending on the size and time since the last one took place.
        During this project a co-op student was hired, and I was tasked with looking after him.
        This mainly involved helping him get set up and finding him tasks to do for the project.</p>
